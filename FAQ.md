### Recense? Why the weird name?
Remember that quote that goes "There are two hard problems in computer science: naming and cache
invalidation"?

Well, I made sure I didn't do any caching for this, but naming I couldn't avoid. And all the "normal" names
were taken, so here we are.

### Is this project open source?
Not right now. My plan with this was to make a tool for myself, and if other people find it useful, maybe run
a crowdsourcing thing to cover the costs. And while I love open source (hell, this page is built entirely on
top of open source tech), maintaining an open source project is a *lot* of work. 

I already maintain what's effectively a quasi-open source project at work, and I don't want to keep doing the
same thing when I go home. But maybe in the future I could release the source code?. We'll see.

I will at least make sure there's no ads, no tracking, no vendor locking of any kind. So even if I don't end
up releasing the source code, your data won't be hostage and you can take it out to any other service.

### Why the spartan look?
I'm fed up with pages that take ages to load. This is my attempt at fighting that trend.
