### Recense? Why the weird name?

Remember this quote?

Well, I made sure I didn't do any caching for this, but naming I couldn't avoid. And all the "normal" names
were taken, so here we are.

### Does this website track me?
Absolutely not. The amount of Javascript this website has is very minimal and unobfuscated, so you can read it
yourself. The only cookie it stores is for authentication (login/logout). You can even opt out of providing an
email account, so you can remain 100% anoymous.

### Is this project open source?
Not right now. Maintaining an open source project is a *lot* of work, and I'm reluctant to open source this
project just because of that. 

I already do that kind of work as my day job (community management, design discussions, code reviews, etc),
and I don't want to keep doing the same thing when I go home. Maybe some day, though.

### Why the spartan look?
I'm fed up with pages that take ages to load. This is my attempt at fighting that trend.


### What's the tech stack behind this?
It's a bunch of Rust code, written in the most straightforward way possible. Nothing fancy, really.
