# Recense

Recense is a bookmarking service. It can help you store links you don't want to lose, or information you want to remember.

To run it, you'll need to have a recent version of Rust installed, and then run this command:

    cargo run --release
    
That should start the Recense server. After that, going to http://localhost:8081 should show you your new Recense instance
