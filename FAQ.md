### Recense? Why the weird name?

Remember this quote?

Well, I made sure I didn't have to do any caching for this, but naming I couldn't avoid. And all the "normal"
names were taken, so here we are.

I remember the name by thinking the website is a "mental census", and so you re-cense that census when you go
over your saved bookmarks.

### What's the business model?
None. This is not a business. This is a tool I wanted to do for myself, and I thought other people might like
it. For now, I'll just pay the bill myself, as I was going to anyway. If the site grows a lot and I have to
get a beefier VM for it, I'll probably run a Patreon or something to cover the costs. That's pretty much it.

### Is this project open source?
Yup, you can find the source code here: [https://github.com/jonvaldes/recense](https://github.com/jonvaldes/recense)

### Does this website track me?
Absolutely not. The amount of Javascript this website has is very minimal and unobfuscated, so you can read it
yourself. The only cookies it stores are for authentication (login/logout) and choosing between light and dark
themes. Also, providing an email account when signing up is optional, so you can remain 100% anoymous.

### Why the spartan look?
I'm fed up with pages that take ages to load. This is my attempt at fighting that trend.
