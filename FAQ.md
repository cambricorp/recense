### Recense? Why the weird name?

Remember this quote?

Well, I made sure I didn't do any caching for this, but naming I couldn't avoid. And all the "normal" names
were taken, so here we are.

### Is this project open source?
Not right now. My plan with this was to primarily make a tool for myself. And if other people like it and find
it useful, maybe run a crowdsourcing thing to cover the costs. And while I love open source (hell, this page
is built entirely on top of open source tech), maintaining an open source project is a *lot* of work. 

I already help maintain a quasi-open source project at work, and I don't want to keep doing the same thing
when I go home. But maybe in the future I could release the source code?. We'll see.

I will at least make sure there's no ads, no tracking and no vendor locking of any kind. Even providing an
email address when creating an account is completely optional. So even if I don't end up releasing the source
code, you can be 100% anonymous, your data won't be held hostage, and you can take it out to any other service
you prefer.

### Why the spartan look?
I'm fed up with pages that take ages to load. This is my attempt at fighting that trend.


### What's the tech stack behind this?
It's a bunch of Rust code, written in the most straightforward way possible. Nothing fancy, really.
